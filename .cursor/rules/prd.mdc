# 🧠 Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Identity Journal iOS App

## 📌 App Summary

This is a minimalistic and emotionally meaningful iOS app built with SwiftUI. It provides a **personal and deep space** for users to document **thoughts, reflections, conclusions, ideas, milestones**, and **insights** that define **who they are and who they are becoming**.

It’s not a productivity app — it’s a **memory of your inner journey**, helping users not to forget what truly matters.
